// StreamID represents a single stream ID. It is up to the transport
// to separate streams as appropriate.

// transport protocol, and also by the Router to pick a Transport for an
// Endpoint.
type Protocol string

// can have multiple endpoints, and are usually resolved from a PeerAddress.

	// Path is a transport-specific path or identifier to connect via. This
	// corresponds to the path, query-string, fragment, and opaque portions of a
	// PeerAddress URL. For example, an in-memory transport might use the URL
	// "memory:foo" to identify a "foo" peer to connect to, where "foo" would
	// become Path. Similarly, "http://host/path" would place "/path" in Path.
	Path string

	// IP is the IP address (v4 or v6) to connect to. If set, this defines the
	// endpoint as a networked endpoint. Networked endpoints are advertised to
	// peers depending on the IP visibility (e.g. private 192.168.0.0 IPs are
	// only advertised to peers on this network, but public IPs are advertised
	// to all peers). Non-networked endpoints are only advertised to other peers
	// connecting via the same protocol.
	IP net.IP

	// Port is the network port (either TCP or UDP). If not set, but IP is set,
	// a default port for the protocol will be used. Note that endpoints
	// returned by Transport.Endpoints() must set a Port number if they wish to
	// autoconfigure e.g. UPnP for NAT traversal.

	// peers, e.g. by expanding out 0.0.0.0 to local interface addresses).
